Extraditing fugitives is hardly ever smooth and simple. Currently the government of India faces the uphill task of extraditing fugitive businessmen Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, who have been booked for numerous offenses including money laundering. While extradition proceedings have been formally initiated against Mallya in the United Kingdom, concrete proceedings are yet to be initiated against Modi due to uncertainty regarding his location. Reports have emerged, however, that Modi has plans to seek political asylum in the U.K. to avoid extradition to India. He may in the future urge the court in U.K. to protect him from extradition on the grounds of Indiaâ€™s poor human rights standards, the same claim put forth by Mallya.
