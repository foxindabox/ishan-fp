A consortium of 13 Indian banks may have won a high court battle against Kingfisher Airlines founder Vijay Mallya on Tuesday, but there are still significant hurdles for the banks ahead.
On Tuesday, a UK high court judge ruled that an Indian judgment against him can legally be enforced against his assets in England and Wales. That judgment states that Mallya owes the banks more than Rs 9,000 crore.
