Once called the "King of Good Times" due to his extravagant lifestyle, Mallya and his companies have been embroiled in financial scandals, and controversies since 2012.[8][9] Mallya left India on 2 March 2016 after saying he wanted to move to Britain to be closer to his children.[8] A group of 17 Indian banks are trying to collect approximately ₹9,000 crore (US$1.4 billion) in loans which Mallya has allegedly routed to gain 100% or a partial stake in about 40 companies across the world. Several agencies including the Income Tax Department and the Central Bureau of Investigation are investigating Mallya for charges including financial fraud and money laundering,[10][11][8][12] and the Attorney General said that Mallya's assets abroad are "far in excess to loans taken by him".[8] The 17 banks added a joint petition at the Supreme Court of India in March 2016 to try to prevent Mallya from leaving the country, but the Indian government indicated that he had already left. The Enforcement Directorate of India also filed a money laundering case against him in March 2016 for allegedly sending abroad some ₹900 crore(US$140 million) that had been loaned to his airline.
