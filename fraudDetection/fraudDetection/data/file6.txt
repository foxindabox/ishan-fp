In February 2018, the Indian government's Central Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation into Modi. The CBI is acting on a complaint from the Punjab National Bank, a state banking institution, that alleges Modi and his partners defrauded the bank for ₹280 Crore (approximately USD 40 million) by conspiring with bank officials to fraudulently obtain Letters of Undertaking for making payments to overseas suppliers.[27] While ₹280 Crore is the fraud that has devolved to date, the potential liability of loss to Punjab National Bank goes up to ₹11000 crore.
